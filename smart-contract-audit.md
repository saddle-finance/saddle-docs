# Smart Contract Security

Smart contracts are subject to flaws, coding errors, unintended behavior, and inefficiencies. Once deployed in the blockchain, smart contracts are immutable (cannot change). At Saddle, we take the security of the smart contract seriously.

We conduct our own internal security audit of the smart contract code we’ve written. As a further check, to make sure Saddle’s code is proper and working as intended, we hire well reputed external agencies to audit our smart contract codes.

As for now, we have passed security auditing on all Saddle smart contracts, from the following auditors, with no issues.

_**Disclaimer**:_ Security audits don’t eliminate all risks. Using Saddle as an exchange for a user should be significantly less risky, but please bear in mind there are still risks. Refer to the risks section for more details.

## **SADDLE ADMIN KEYS SECURITY**

A [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io) multisig secures Saddle’s admin keys. Gnosis is a trusted platform to manage digital assets in Ethereum. Gnosis Safe is a smart contract wallet running on Ethereum, which requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur (M-of-N). This assures that no single person could compromise the funds.

A [3/8 Gnosis Safe multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3F8E527aF4e0c6e763e8f368AC679c44C45626aE) secures Saddle's admin keys. The signers are Mariano Conti, Sam Kazemian, DegenSpartan, Klim K, Damir Bandalo, Aurelius, Scoopy Trooples, and Weston Nelson.

_Note: The multisig has the capability to pause new deposits and trades in case of technical emergency. Users will always be able to withdraw their funds regardless of new deposits being paused. The multisig can also change the swap/withdrawal fees and the per pool/account deposit limits._

## **BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM**

We encourage the community to help us find bugs or vulnerabilities in the protocol, and offer a bounty to those who do so with good intention. With the passing of [SIP-29](https://snapshot.org/#/saddlefinance.eth/proposal/0x867fd038ed31a996901dead7ffbb32b2fcd38408e5924e7f489dbf7f62cbdcd0), the bounty is to be calculated as the lower value of 10% of the total possible exploit, or 5MM SDL. The bounty will be delivered immediately as liquid SDL.

_Note: This bounty does not cover any front-end/visual bugs, or any server-side code of any web application that interacts with Saddle. The Saddle Bug Bounty is applicable only to vulnerable smart contract code: defined as contracts deployed by Saddle, on any chain, that manage the value of Saddle’s treasury assets and/or user deposited assets. This bounty is a "no questions asked" policy for disclosures and/or immediate return of funds after any incident._

### **Reporting Process**

Please report any bugs and issues for the Saddle protocol through the [Immunefi Saddle bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/saddle/). Reports through any other channels will not be considered.

### **Immunefi Terms & Conditions**

These [Terms and Conditions](https://immunefi.com/bounty/saddle/) cover your participation in the Immunefi Bug Bounty Program. By submitting any vulnerabilities to Saddle Finance or otherwise participating in the Program in any manner, you accept these Terms.
