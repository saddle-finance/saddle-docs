## **Who built Saddle?**

Saddle is built by DeFi natives with prior years of developer experience at Web2 companies like Uber, Amazon, and Square. As regular DeFi users ourselves, we’ve seen first-hand how important an active and vibrant community is for a project’s success. We know Web2, but we know Web3 better.

You might have interacted with our founder [Sunil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunilsrivatsa/) (aka [devops199fan](https://twitter.com/devops199fan)) in the YFI community (he’s a multisig signer), or used tools created by members of our team, like [yieldfarming.info](https://yieldfarming.info) by [John](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jongseunglim/) (aka [Weeb\_Mcgee](https://twitter.com/Weeb\_Mcgee)).
