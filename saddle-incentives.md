# Saddle Incentives

## **SADDLE REWARDS**

Saddle _does not_ have a token currently and offers no Saddle specific incentives. However, we offer incentives from other protocols. The [liquidity providers](https://docs.saddle.finance/saddle-faq#who-is-a-liquidity-provider) are rewarded for their contribution to the liquidity pool. Depending on the liquidity pool, the rewards structure varies.

### **Terminologies**

The terminologies used across Saddle are:

**Earned Fees**: Any earnings of _**Trading Fees**_ and/or _**Flash Loan Fees**_ from providing liquidity to the Saddle pools.

**Incentives**: The incentives from the _**Saddle protocol and/or partners protocols**_. For e.g., KEEP, ALCX. _Note:_ Currently there are no Saddle protocol specific incentives.

**Rewards**: Refers collectively to both _**earned fees and incentives**_.

### **APY & APR**

Before we cover the pool specific rewards, let’s understand the difference between APY and APR.

**Annual Percentage Yield (APY):** APY refers to the amount of interest a liquidity provider earns over one year. APY is like an interest rate, but the biggest benefit of APY is the _compounding_.

**Annual Percentage Rate (APR):** APR does not factor compounding and represents the annual interest rate.

Let’s take a scenario of 1% interest each month. Therefore,

|                                                |                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **APR at 1% interest per month**               | **APY at 1% interest per month**                  |
| APR = Periodic Rate x No. of Periods in a Year | APY = (1 + Periodic Rate) `Number of periods` – 1 |
| APR = 1% X 12 months                           | APY = (1+1%)`12`-1                                |
| 12.00%                                         | 12.68%                                            |

### **Saddle APY & Reward APR**

In Saddle both APY and APR are available as rewards to the liquidity providers. The prevailing rates are available in the [pool details](https://docs.saddle.finance/saddle-pools).

**APY pay-out**: In Saddle, APY is calculated based on the last 24 hour volume. In the event of no volume, then you will observe “-” in the Saddle dApp frontend. The trading fees compound automatically for every transaction and are paid when the liquidity providers withdraw their funds.

**APR pay-out**: Saddle partners provide the pool specific APR incentives. Refer to the pool specific section for details.

### **Staking LP Tokens**

The _typical_ process to take part in the reward program is to stake the LP tokens. Refer to the pool specific sections to know more about the reward program provided by our partners.
