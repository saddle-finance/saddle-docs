# Build With Saddle

Saddle combines the best of three worlds – Bitcoin, Pegged Value Assets, and Ethereum DeFi. Saddle is an [automated market maker](https://docs.saddle.finance/automated-market-makers) \(AMM\) enabling trading between [pegged value crypto assets](https://docs.saddle.finance/saddle-faq#what-are-pegged-value-crypto-assets-pegged-assets). We solve the [slippage problem](https://docs.saddle.finance/saddle-faq#what-is-a-slippage) with a tailored AMM allowing users to trade with minimal slippage.

### **Our Values**

Saddle stands for DeFi, for financial Lego blocks.

- We commit ourselves to [open-source software](https://github.com/saddle-finance) and collaboration.
- We support all projects that want on top of our code
- We’ll work with you if you want to bring stablecoin swap to another chain.

### **Collaborate With Saddle**

We welcome an opportunity to work with you. Here are a few ways to collaborate:

- Work together on implementing our code, provide engineering support, and answer questions
- Feature you and your project in our upcoming AMA series
- Promote your project across our social channels
- Token swaps and joint projects

We have just a few asks in return – kindly give us credits on your social channels and include us in any token distributions :\)

## **FEATURED PROJECTS**

The following projects have used Saddle’s protocol code, with varying degrees of collaboration and support.

### **SushiSwap V2**

_**Project**_**:** [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/) is an automated market-making \(AMM\) decentralized exchange \(DEX\). Besides DEX, SushiSwap involves a collection of governance, operations and reward contracts that help grow the ecosystem and utilization.

_**Chain**_**:** Ethereum blockchain.

_**Partnership**_: SushiSwap’s AMM uses Saddle’s StableSwap implementation for the pegged-assets pool.

_**Key People**_: SushiSwap was created in 2020 by a pseudonymous individual or group called [Chef Nomi](https://twitter.com/NomiChef), along with co-founders, Sushiswap and [0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xMaki).

### **Nerve Finance / Synapse**

_**Project**_**:** [Nerve](https://nerve.fi/) / [Synapse](https://synapseprotocol.com/) is a StableSwap automated market maker and trustless cross-chain bridge.

_**Chain**_**:** Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum.

_**Partnership**_: Nerve/Synapse’s AMM uses Saddle’s StableSwap implementation for pegged-asset pools and Ethereum off-ramp.

_**Key People**_: Nerve/Synapse's team stays [anonymous](https://docs.nerve.fi/faq#analytics). But you can follow the core team members via their twitter links [\(@AureliusBTC](https://twitter.com/AureliusBTC) and [@Socrates0x](https://twitter.com/Socrates0x)\).

### **Snowball**

_**Project**_**:** [Snowball](https://snowball.network/) is a yield optimizer on the Avalanche Network. Snowball combines multiple DeFi protocols to create an interconnected experience. Swap stablecoins, deposit liquidity, or auto-compound liquidity rewards.

_**Chain**_**:** Avalanche Network.

_**Partnership**_: Saddle financed Snowball’s AMM audits. Snowball also airdropped us their governance tokens.

_**Key People**_: The team is currently anon & was started by [@AbominableSasquatch](https://twitter.com/AbominableSas).

### **Iron Finance**

_**Project**_**:** [Iron Finance](https://iron.finance/) is a multi-chain, decentralized, non-custodial ecosystem of DeFi products, protocols, and use cases. IronSwap is an automated market maker \(AMM\) specialized for fast and efficient stablecoin swapping, aiming to have the best rates with the lowest fees and smallest slippage.

_**Chain**_**:** Polygon Network.

_**Partnership**_: IronSwap’s AMM uses Saddle’s StableSwap implementation for the pegged-assets pool.

_**Key People**_: The Iron Finance team is currently anonymous.

### **Hop Protocol**

_**Project**_**:** [Hop](https://hop.exchange/) is a scalable rollup-to-rollup general token bridge. It allows users to send tokens from one rollup or sidechain to another almost immediately without having to wait for the networks challenge period. It works by involving market makers \(referred to as Bonder\) who front the liquidity at the destination chain for a small fee. The Bonder extends this credit in the form of hTokens which are then swapped for their native token counterpart in an AMM. The result allows users to seamlessly transfer tokens from one network to the next.

_**Chain**_**:** Ethereum, Polygon, xDai, Optimism, Arbitrum.

_**Partnership**_: Hop uses Saddle’s StableSwap as the AMM bridge.

_**Key People**_: The team comprises [Chris Whinfrey](https://twitter.com/whinfreychris) and [Shane Fontaine](https://twitter.com/shanefontaine).
